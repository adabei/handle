# Handle
Handle is an IRC client made for Windows using the Metro design language and state of the art technologies.

According to the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) there is a good chance you use 20% of your current client's features 80% of the time which is exactly where Handle shines. 
Our goal is to polish these 20% while keeping the rest in the background, and in result provide a superior experience.
